This is my reference for a basic devcontainer implementation,
based on the Graceful Dev devcontainers course [here](https://graceful.dev/courses/devcontainers/).

Requires Docker 🙂

Bring the container up and get a shell with:

    ./scripts/devcontainer-shell.sh

then to get a bovine greeting, run:

    ./hello.sh
